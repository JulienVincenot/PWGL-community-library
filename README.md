# PWGL Community library
This is dedicated to salvage all of known user-libraries created by composers and music researchers for the late PWGL environment (2002-2020).
Although the development of PWGL seems definitely discontinued after the 64-bit transition (the official website also disappeared around the Fall 2020), it is still possible to run PWGL via emulation thanks to the method proposed by Paulo Raposo.
