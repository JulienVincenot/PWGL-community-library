:bodytext "All the functions grouped here can be applied to any kind of parameters that can be represented with numbers."

:bodytext "This part of the jbs-profile library is dedicated to the concept of geometric reflexion. The main idea is to create a sort of simulation of the geometrical reflexion around one or two axes. 

As we have already seen in the first part of this library, the fact that a lot of functions here are based on pitches, that does not mean at all that these functions are limited to the pitch fields."
