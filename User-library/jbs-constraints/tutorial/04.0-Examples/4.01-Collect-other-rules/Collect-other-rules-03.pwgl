This patch gives you another example of how you can apply some rules written in the text syntax of Mikael Luarson. 

In this case I used the ENP-SCRIPT [5] to solve a score treatment.

In [1] I wrote a score.

In the COLLECT-SCRIPT-RULES [2] I define one rule for the fourth voice (CREATE-EXPRESSION-ON-MAIN-BEAT) that puts an accent on each main beat for each measure. I define also that for the first part I want to put an, accent on each not main beat of each measure (CREATE-EXPRESSION-NOT-ON-MAIN-BEAT).

In the TEXT-BOX [3] I defined four rules written in Laurson syntax. Here is the detail:
1. When it finds an interval bigger than a minor third, I ask for a slur;
2. When it finds four different pitches (in any modulo 12) I ask for a fermata;
3. When there are three consecutive descending notes, I ask for a diminuendo;
4. When there are three consecutive descending notes and the first interval is smaller than a minor third, then I ask for a group.

Please choose with the RULE-FILTER [a] which rule you want to apply. You can chose all of them if you want. 
Then select the ENP-SCRIPT [5] : first type R on the keyboard in order to reset the Score-Editor, then type V on the keyboard and look at the result. 
If you change the selection of rules inside the RULE-FILTER [a], to better see the result, please select again the ENP-SCRIPT [5] : first type R to reset and then V and look at the result." :X 0 :Y 0 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
