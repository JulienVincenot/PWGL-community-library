:subtitle "Palestrina's four voices counterpoint"

:bodytext "This series of patches is conceived as part of the tutorial for the Multi-Score-PMC.

This exercise (which is not at all a goal in itself) tries to reproduce the Palestrina counterpoint of first specie. That means a four voices counterpoint in which all the notes have the same face value (1/4).

The conception of these patches is absolutely consistent. Go from the first to the last in the order. What is explained in one patch is not longer explained in the next ones."
