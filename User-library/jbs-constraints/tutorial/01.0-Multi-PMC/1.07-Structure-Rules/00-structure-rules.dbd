:bodytext "This part of the library is dedicated to the control of structures. The notion of a structure is hard to define in this kind of software. In general I make the difference between a list, a sequence and a structure. The interpretation of any phenomenon is articulated under the form of structures. It means here that the rules will generate some sequences but these sequences will be interpreted in function of a given context. In this sense, the same rule here can produce a structure that is meaningful for a rhythm sequence and another that is meaningful for an interval sequence."
