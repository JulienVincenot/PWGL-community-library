:bodytext "The following rules are conceived for pitches. For that reason sometimes this tutorial refers to the modulo 12 (or 24, or 48 if we work with quarter or eighth of tones). Please if you do not know the function g-mod, see the PWGL documentation about it.

Just as a reminder : arithmetic modulo 12 is used by musicians, for instance, in consideration of the twelve-tones equal temperament system, where octave and enharmonic equivalency occurs."
