:subtitle "Generic-Rules Menu"
:bodytext "All the functions grouped here can be applied on any kind of parameters. That is why they are called generic.

Please note that often in this library you can find different rules, from different categories and menus, based on the same code or a really close one. 
These rules are redundant on purpose, in order to make easier your understanding of the musical concepts implemented.

You must understand that most of the rules described above are not necessarily dedicated to a single use. Most of them are generalizable to different musical parameters. 
The numerous patches in this tutorial only give you a partial sight of their possibilities."
