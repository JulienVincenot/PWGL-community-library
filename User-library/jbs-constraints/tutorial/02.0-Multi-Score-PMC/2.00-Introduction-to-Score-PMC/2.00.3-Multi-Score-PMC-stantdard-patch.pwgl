Here I suggest you how to dispose the boxes in order to have as much as possible control on the entire process to find solutions.

You have to accept (at this level) that the rhythm of the solution is given by a SCORE-EDITOR.
The rhythm can be provided by other calculations, or you could also have written it by hand, within the SCORE-EDITOR. 
So [1] is just a sort of default starting value. Without it the Multi-Score-PMC doesn't work.

In the other SCORE-EDITOR [2] you'll see the result when you evaluate the Multi-Score-PMC.
One of the main differences between the Multi-Score-PMC and the Multi-PMC is that the first outputs its musical result (rhythm, pitches and expressions) in the SCORE-EDITOR on the right [2] and not with its own output.

The COLLECT-RULES [3] works exactly as for the Multi-PMC. It is the collector for all the rules you need. 
The order of insertion of the rules, or empty inputs (nil) do not affect the result. 
The right output is connected to the true/false rule input and the left to the heuristic rule input of the Multi-Score-PMC.

In the value-box [4] you can set the pitch search space in the 'expand-list' syntax. 
It means that if you put (60_72) the value box will output this arithmetic series : 
(60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72).

Please evaluate the Multi-Score-PMC [5] and look at the right SCORE-EDITOR [2] in order to see the result. 
As in this patch the random mode [a] is set on T, for each evaluation you get a random research.

ATTENTION : I suggest you this configuration at the very beginning. Later we will see some variations concerning abstractions for rules or candidates." :X 0 :Y 0 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
