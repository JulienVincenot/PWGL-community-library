:title "Introduction"

:bodytext "Viuhka (Finnish, in English 'Fan') is a user-library designed for and based on ideas by the Finnish composer Paavo Heininen. The system was originally realized by the author in the mid 1990s. Viuhka allows the user to create complex, multi-layered musical textures. These can be used to produce scores for instrumental music and/or to provide material for sound synthesis. The end result of a Viuhka patch can either be displayed in a music notation editor or in a piano-roll display. Finally, the resulting texture is translated to a synthesis file. More recently the Viuhka system has been adapted to PWGL and it is used, for example, for our macro-note scheme that allows the simulation of complex playing techniques for physics-based instrument models (Laurson & Kuuskankare, 2008)."

:bodytext "The starting point in Viuhka is a group of break-point functions ('Viuhka bpfs') that constitute the pitch field (harmonic skeleton) of the result. Viuhka bpfs provide the main pitch material which can then be reacted to (or elaborated on) by different sorts of Viuhka ornaments. Besides typical ornaments (like grace notes, trills, etc.), the Viuhka ornaments can also be runs, repetitions, chords, clusters, clouds or even complete Viuhka patches (i.e. a Viuhka patch can contain other Viuhka patches). The user typically divides a Viuhka patch into musical time slices or segments. The durations of the segments are given as a list of delta-times (or time intervals). The structure of each segment (i.e. number of layers, rhythmic structure, time modification, ornaments and synthesis information) is normally given inside an abstraction window. There the user defines the Viuhka parameter values by using 'v- params' and optional 'i-params' boxes (the former boxes are used to define note events, while the latter ones normally define synthesis parameters). The output of the 'v-params' boxes is then given to the main Viuhka box (called 'mk-viuhka'), which in turn calculates the final score."
