Les permutations symétriques consiste a numéroter (code-lst) des durées chromatiques choisies (lst) [ ou autre référence symbolique ] et de les relire toujours dans le même ordre de lecture.

------
On trouve des permutations symétriques dans ma Chronochromie pour grand orchestre. Pour en comprendre l'utilité, il faut se rappeler que le nombre de permutations possibles avec plusieurs objets augmente démesurément à chaque ajout d'une nouvelle unité. Ainsi le nombre 2 n'a que 2 permutations, le nombre 5 en a déjà 120. Si nous poussons jusqu'au nombre 12, celui-ci possède 479 millions, 1.600 permutations. Les permutations symétriques vont nous permettre de supprimer les ressemblances, les redites partielles, et de travailler sur un nombre de permutations beaucoup plus petit.
