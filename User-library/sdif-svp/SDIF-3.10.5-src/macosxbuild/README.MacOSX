[Remark: SDIF.xcode and SDIF.pbproj are actually directories on Unix,
but appear as files on Mac.]



Building on Mac OS-X 10.3 or higher with XCODE
==============================================

The file macosxbuild/SDIF.xcode builds a framework containing the
SDIF library and exported header files.



Building on Mac OS-X with Project Builder
=========================================

The file macosxbuild/SDIF.pbproj builds a framework containing the
SDIF library and exported header files.



Building on Mac OS-X with gcc and the automake/autoconf system
==============================================================

You can also build from a terminal in the usual way (see file INSTALL).


Support for shared libraries
----------------------------

The default behavior of the configure script is to enable 
the use of shared librairies. While libtool
exists for MacOSX most versions are not working properly.
Therefore, we recommand to disable creation of shared libraries
under  MacOSX  by means of adding the configure
option --disable-shared to the configuration command line.
So under MacOSX the prefered configuration command line would read

> ./configure --disable-shared
