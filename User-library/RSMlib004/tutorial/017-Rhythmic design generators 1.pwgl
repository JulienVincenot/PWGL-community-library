rhythmic similarity measures. In this first release of the library there is not yet a rhythm generator as such but some functions are included that I consider might be useful to composers. Some of these functions have been used in the generation of the rhythmic content of several of my recent pieces.  
In this example we can see how to generate rhythms related to a given rhythmic design according to its profile representation." :X 0 :Y 0 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
