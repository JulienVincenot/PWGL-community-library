give us more complete information depending on the case.

For this purpose we have two objects which give us a Set representation of a given rhythmic design (Pearsall 1997). It returns a list of list being the first member the number of times the value appears and the second member being the value itself.
Please, evaluate both boxes and notice the difference between representations.
It is recommended to try with different scores since the input score is very important for take decisions about which method of representation to use." :X 5 :Y 5 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
