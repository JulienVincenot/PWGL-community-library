What they don't usually do is to pay attention to where - in what position - the differences happen.
In music, it is very meaningful to know the position of the changes since the impact of the change is greater if the change is closer to the beginning. I implemented several weighted similarity measures that are very sensitive to this aspect especially if they are used with first level rhythmic representations.
In the example we can compare the differences between weighted and non weighted measures and the differences arising from using first level representation (face-values) and second level representation (time-point)." :X 0 :Y 0 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
