Symmetric series 2.

These objects generate a random symmetric series divided into two non-chromatic hexachords. This is the main difference respect to precedent example.

\"h+th\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the transposition of the first one.

\"h+rh\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the retrograde (transposed) of the first one.

\"h+ih\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the inversion (transposed) of the first one.

\"h+rih\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the retrograde inversion (transposed) of the first one.
