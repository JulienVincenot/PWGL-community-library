Symmetric series 3.

These objects generate a random symmetric series divided into three chromatic tetrachords.

\"4+4+4_h+th\" divides the series into three parts in which second and third ones are the transpositions of the first.

\"4+4+4_h+rh\" divides the series into three parts in which into three parts in which second and third ones are the retrograde (transposed) of the first.

\"4+4+4_h+ih\" divides the series into three parts in which into three parts in which second and third ones are the inversions (transposed) of the first.

\"4+4+4_h+rih\" divides the series into three parts in which into three parts in which second and third ones are the retrograde inversions (transposed) of the first.
