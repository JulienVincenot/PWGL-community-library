Symmetric series 1.

These objects generate a random symmetric series in which first half series contains the first chromatic hexachord (pitch-classes 0 to 5), and the second half series the remainder.

\"6+6_h+th\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the transposition of the first one.

\"6+6_h+rh\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the retrograde (transposed) of the first one.

\"6+6_h+ih\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the inversion (transposed) of the first one.

\"6+6_h+rih\" divides the series into two parts in which second half is the retrograde inversion (transposed) of the first one.
