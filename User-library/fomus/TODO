TODO LIST

Immediate:

    Bugs:
      XML output blows up (with percussion instruments?)
      Weird number choices for some tuplets (12 instead of 6, 10 instead of 5, etc.)
      Double brackets shouldn't appear in the same place (6 violins example)
      Send list of XML issues to Sibelius/Finale tech. support
      In CLISP/Cygwin output from executables isn't suppressed (fixable?)
    Documentation:
      Plugin interface
      Proofreading
      More examples (eventually indexed and covering most/all features)
    Backends:
      MusicXML invisible rests (possible?)
      CMN grace notes preceding rests
      CMN tremolos
      CMN cautionary accidentals on chords
      CMN part groups/brackets
      LilyPond not tying repeated notes in chords where other notes are tied (fixable in next LilyPond version)
      MIDI output testing/adjusting/fine tuning
    Improvements:
      Shortcuts for some marks (example: (:slurto 1) to slur to next note, (:slurto 2) for next two, etc.)
      Check Finale and Siblius updates for changes in MusicXML import
      Laissez vibrer ties (options to automatically add l.v. ties with autodurs)
      Finish chunks support
      Finish key signatures support
      Finish implementing :invisible mark
      Allow forcing of staff choices (individual notes and entire voice)
      Improve staff and clef decisions
      More control over harmonics
      More speed improvements (why is it 10x slower in OpenMCL?)
      Quantization plugins
    Additions:
      Onset-to-onset durations
      Specifying percussion from MIDI info
      Automatic percussion instrument changes
      Splitting chords across staves
      Presets for customizing auto-algorithms
      Some more marks:
        pedal on/off
        double/triple tongue
        bartok pizz.
      Number of lines in staff (single-line for percussion)

Short Term:

    Ornaments with accidentals greater than a whole/half step
    Proportional notation
    Support for polymeters in backends

Long Term:

    Fractional meters and tuplets
