                                                     About ksquant
      
      The ksquant package (called so for simplicity...) provides means for
      working with rhythmical structures without loosing the connection to
      the other parameters like pitch information, expressions etc...
      
      To ease operations on these structures, it introduces a new score
      format (called simple-format) that is derived from the
      ENP-score-notation format (which is used e.g. by the score-editor).
      
      The main difference between those formats is that the simple-format is
      duration based. Instead of using a tree-like structure like in ENP,
      events start at a certain time point and their duration is specified
      by the time that passes until the next event occurs. The ENP format is
      definitely more expressive when it comes to the exact description of
      rhythmical structures - the simple-format can be seen as a
      possible reduction.
      
      To this purpose, its provides mainly two conversion functions:
      
        * score2simple
        * simple2score

      A perfect conversion using simple2score is not always possible.
      This is where quantization comes in.
      
      Then, there are some operations using the simple-format:
      
        * simple-shift
        * simple-scale
        * simple-transpose
        * ...
