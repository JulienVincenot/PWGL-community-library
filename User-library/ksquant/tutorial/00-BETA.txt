      Please note that this release is really a beta release - the library is not
      finished yet.
      
      You can always find the version of ksquant in the file ksquant.asd.
      
      I hope, however, that this package could already be useful.
      
      For a future release, I hope to have a better tutorial and also
      documentation for the boxes.      

      Any questions, comments on bugs, inconsistencies, possible improvements,
      and also your success stories :) are highly welcome.
